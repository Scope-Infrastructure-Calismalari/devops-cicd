Two examples of popular GitOps frameworks that use the pull-based approach are [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) and [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). ArgoCD is implemented as a Kubernetes controller, while Flux is built with the GitOps Toolkit, a set of APIs and controllers that can be used to extend Flux, or even build a custom delivery platform.

***Will be extended soon.***
